step-by-step TBC - available circa 5pm, inc. bill of materials and troubleshooting

Components:
- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller
- Light-dependent resistor of appropriate peak wavelength (here, 550nm) for laser to be measured, soldered onto wire with header pins
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Resistor which allows best dynamic range for LDR used
- Adafruit 1115 16-bit ADC (with associated drivers installed into Arduino IDE)
- Syringe (or equivalent sample holder in which to place the LDR at sample position)
- Electrical tape for rudimentary waterproofing
